# Version 1.2.2 - Critical Bug Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Syntax Error: `install.sh: line 348: syntax error: unexpected end of file`**

**Problem:** The install.sh script was missing closing `fi` statements and had incomplete control flow structures.

**Fix:** 
- Added proper closing statements for all conditional blocks
- Ensured all if/else/fi blocks are properly balanced
- Added final summary section for installation completion

**Result:** Script now parses and executes without syntax errors.

### 2. **Varnish Service Timeout: `Job for varnish.service failed because a timeout was exceeded`**

**Problem:** Varnish service was timing out during startup due to default systemd timeout being too short (90 seconds by default).

**Fixes Implemented:**

#### a) **Extended Systemd Timeout**
```bash
# Created override configuration
mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/varnish.service.d
cat > /etc/systemd/system/varnish.service.d/timeout.conf << 'EOF'
[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=60
TimeoutStopSec=30
Type=notify
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
EOF
```

#### b) **Retry Logic**
```bash
# Start Varnish with retry mechanism (up to 3 attempts)
for i in {1..3}; do
    if systemctl start varnish; then
        echo "✓ Varnish started successfully"
        sleep 2
        break
    else
        echo "⚠ Attempt $i: Varnish failed to start, retrying..."
        sleep 3
    fi
done
```

#### c) **Improved VCL Configuration**
Added connection timeout settings to VCL:
```vcl
backend default {
    .host = "127.0.0.1";
    .port = "8080";
    .connect_timeout = 5s;
    .first_byte_timeout = 15s;
    .between_bytes_timeout = 10s;
}
```

#### d) **Service Startup Verification**
Added comprehensive checks and logging:
```bash
if systemctl is-active --quiet varnish; then
    echo "✓ Varnish is running"
else
    echo "✗ Warning: Varnish failed to start after retries"
    echo "  Checking Varnish logs..."
    journalctl -u varnish -n 20 --no-pager
fi
```

**Result:** Varnish now starts reliably with automatic retry and better error diagnostics.

### 3. **cPanel Plugin Configuration Error**

**Problem:** cPanel plugin registration failed with error:
```
/var/cpanel/apps/varnish_cache_manager.conf is an invalid application configuration file. 
It must specify 'service' and 'url'
```

**Fix:** Updated appconfig format to include all required fields:
```yaml
---
group: Software
name: Varnish Cache Manager
version: 1.0.0
vendor: TurnUp Hosting
description: "Manage Varnish cache for improved website performance"
url: /frontend/paper_lantern/varnish_user/cgi/varnish_user.cgi
service: varnish
icon: icon-performance.png
features:
  - cache-management
```

**Result:** cPanel plugin now registers properly without errors.
